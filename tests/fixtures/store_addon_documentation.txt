# Home Assistant Add-on: Mosquitto broker

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Find the "Mosquitto broker" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

The add-on has a couple of options available. To get the add-on running:

1. Start the add-on.
2. Have some patience and wait a couple of minutes.
3. Check the add-on log output to see the result.

Create a new user for MQTT via your Home Assistant's frontend **Settings** -> **People** -> **Users** , (i.e. not on Mosquitto's **Configuration** tab).
Notes:

1. This name cannot be `homeassistant` or `addons`, those are reserved usernames.
2. If you do not see the option to create a new user, ensure that **Advanced Mode** is enabled in your Home Assistant profile.

To use the Mosquitto as a broker, go to the integration page and install the configuration with one click:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Integrations**.
2. MQTT should appear as a discovered integration at the top of the page
3. Select it and check the box to enable MQTT discovery if desired, and hit submit.

If you have old MQTT settings available, remove this old integration and restart Home Assistant to see the new one.
